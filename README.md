# macOS Web Desktop Simulation

## Overview
This project is a browser‑based simulation of the macOS desktop environment. It recreates the familiar look and feel of macOS — including windows, dock, and menus — entirely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The simulation demonstrates front‑end engineering, UI/UX design, and system interaction modeling, making it a strong showcase of technical creativity and problem‑solving.

## Key Highlights
- **Design & UX**: Faithfully mirrors macOS aesthetics with responsive layouts and interactive elements  
- **Technology**: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — lightweight and portable  
- **Accessibility**: Runs directly in the browser, no installation required  
- **Customizable**: Extendable with themes, icons, and simulated applications
